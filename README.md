The primary use of the app is to quickly navigate to things you need every day,

>>>>>CM:GREEN
resources, and even people if you want to quickly start a teams chat.

>>>>>CM:GREEN

## Contribution guide

>>>>>CM:GREEN
There are two ways in which you can contribute. If you have an idea for a plugin
>>>>>CM:GREEN
for TQL, you can write your own. Have a look at the
>>>>>CM:GREEN
[Create a plugin](https://tqlapp.github.io/TQL/Documentation/Create-a-plugin.html)
>>>>>CM:GREEN
documentation on the developers website on how to do this. You don't have to
>>>>>CM:GREEN
create a PR for this! You can publish your own plugin from your own repository
>>>>>CM:GREEN
and have it work with TQL.

>>>>>CM:GREEN
If you want to contribute to TQL directly, we welcome PRs. See the
>>>>>CM:GREEN
[Development environment](https://tqlapp.github.io/TQL/Documentation/Development-environment.html)
>>>>>CM:GREEN
wiki page for information on how to setup a local development environment for
>>>>>CM:GREEN
TQL.

>>>>>CM:GREEN
You can have a look at the issue log and find an issue you'd like to pick up. If
>>>>>CM:GREEN
you have an idea for a feature request, best is to create a
>>>>>CM:GREEN
[feature request issue](https://github.com/TQLApp/TQL/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=)
>>>>>CM:GREEN
for this and mention that you'd like to contribute it yourself. We'll use the
>>>>>CM:GREEN
comments on the issue to discuss whether the feature is a good fit for the tool.

>>>>>CM:GREEN
We also welcome localization of TQL. See the
>>>>>CM:GREEN
[Localize TQL](https://tqlapp.github.io/TQL/Documentation/Localize-TQL.html)
>>>>>CM:GREEN
wiki page for instructions on how to do this. I maintain English and Dutch
>>>>>CM:GREEN
myself, and I welcome contributions for any other language.
