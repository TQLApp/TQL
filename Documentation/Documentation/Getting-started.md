# Getting started

Great, you want to write your own plugin for TQL! These pages walk you through
this process front to end, from setting up a new project to deploying your new
plugin to https://nuget.org so that users can find it.

In this guide, we'll create a plugin for https://nuget.org to search packages.
First we'll create basic functionality to search for NuGet packages. We'll then
expand this to list versions of a NuGet package. Lastly we'll add a
configuration page to allow the user to identify himself so that he can find his
own NuGet packages eaiser.

We'll create this as a stand alone solution that publishes a NuGet package that
we can push to https://nuget.org.

If anything is unclear in this tutorial, I would be very grateful if you create
an issue for this.
