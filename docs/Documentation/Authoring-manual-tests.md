# Authoring manual tests

We use https://testspace.com for manual regression testing. Testspace uses
Markdown files as the format for the manual test cases. These test cases are in
the `/Specs` folder.

You can run Jekyll to locally preview the test cases. This requires setup as
described in https://help.testspace.com/manual/desktop-preview. Note that when
downloading Ruby, you need Ruby+DevKit.
