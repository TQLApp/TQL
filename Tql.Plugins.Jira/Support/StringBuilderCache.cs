** Class:  StringBuilderCache
**
** Purpose: provide a cached reusable instance of StringBuilder
**          per thread  it's an optimisation that reduces the
**          number of instances constructed and collected.
**
**  Acquire - is used to get a string builder to use of a
**            particular size.  It can be called any number of
**            times, if a StringBuilder is in the cache then
**            it will be returned and the cache emptied.
**            subsequent calls will return a new StringBuilder.
**
**            A StringBuilder instance is cached in
**            Thread Local Storage and so there is one per thread
**
**  Release - Place the specified builder in the cache if it is
**            not too big.
**            The StringBuilder should not be used after it has
**            been released.
**            Unbalanced Releases are perfectly acceptable.  It
**            will merely cause the runtime to create a new
**            StringBuilder next time Acquire is called.
**
**  GetStringAndRelease
**          - ToString() the StringBuilder, Release it to the
**            cache and return the resulting string
